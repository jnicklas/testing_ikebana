# TDD
## Sounds boring!

!SLIDE

# Realization!
## manual testing is boring

!SLIDE

* Build something
* Check that it works
* Check that nothing broke

!SLIDE

# Now do that 1000 times

!SLIDE

* Build something
* Know that it works
* Know that nothing broke

!SLIDE

# Ruby
## Test obsessed

!SLIDE

# Legacy code
## Is code which does not have any tests

!SLIDE

# Another realization
## Testing is not about regressions

!SLIDE

# Improving design

!SLIDE

# Benefits of testing

* Refactoring
* Design

!SLIDE

# No one writes perfect code
## on the first try

!SLIDE

# Make changes without affecting functionality

!SLIDE

# How do you know?

!SLIDE

# Manually
## Tiresome – makes you less likely to do it

!SLIDE

# Automated
## Write it once, never think about it again

!SLIDE

## Once code is written
# it will never be changed

!SLIDE

# The Quality of Code
## Lies in how easy it is to change

!SLIDE

# Test driven
## vs
# Test first

!SLIDE

# TDD means
## the tests influence your design

!SLIDE

## Painful testing means
# design isn't good enough

!SLIDE

## Well structured code
# is easy to test
